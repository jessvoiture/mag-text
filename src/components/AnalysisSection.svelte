      The numbers are damning. But is this discrepancy merely an anomaly? Did
      the bump simply speak for itself? Iâ€™m afraid the answer is no. But, before
      we dive into data on Vogue's recent relationship with text, let's go back
      a bit further.

      In the early 20th century, Vogue covers featured illustrations. The
      intention was to create covers so beautiful that one might consider
      hanging them as a <a

        >poster</a
      >, thus creatively dubbed poster covers. The 1930s saw the transition from
      illustrated covers to photographed ones, with Vogue debuting its first
      cover with a

        >photograph</a
      > in 1932. Despite this shift in medium, the poster-like aesthetic retained
      its allure. While publications toyed with text placement, the focal point invariably
      remained the central image (hands up, they were stunning).

      Towards the midpoint of the century, the economic underpinnings of many
      magazines shifted from

      This economic shift manifested on the covers, as they now functioned as an
      advertisement. Text describing the magazine's contents (referred to as cover
      lines in industry parlance) began infiltrating the

      This trend continued to persist and mature throughout the 20th century and

      becoming the editor-in-chief of US Vogue in 1988. Aside from inspiring the
      cinematic tour de force, The Devil Wears Prada, and stealing the bob
      limelight from Edna Mode, Wintour played an instrumental role in
      redefining Vogue's cover aesthetics. She advocated for the appearance of
      more actors, musicians, and political figures on the cover of Vogue,
      positioning the magazine as a cultural lodestar offering access to eminent
