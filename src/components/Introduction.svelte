      Do you remember where you were when Rihanna’s May 2022 US Vogue cover
      story dropped? The photographs, lensed by Annie Leibovitz, and the
      fashion, styled by Alex Harrington and Jahleel Weaver, were nothing short
      of transcendental.

      The cover was like many Vogue covers, complete with the signature masthead
      at the top and a photo portrait. But the only text on the cover (other
      than the Vogue masthead) read, “Oh, Baby! Rihanna’s Plus One.”

      gone?

      I was set in motion to unearth the lost art of textual exuberance. In this
      extremely important, time sensitive, and highly requested endeavour, I
      analysed 22 years of US Vogue covers to ascertain if the amount of text on
      covers had indeed dwindled. Please, enjoy.
