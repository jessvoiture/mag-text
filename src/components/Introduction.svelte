      Contemporary philosopher Carrie Bradshaw once said, “When I first moved to
      New York and I was totally broke, sometimes I would buy Vogue instead of
      dinner. I felt it fed me more.” Indeed, Vogue Magazine has been nourishing
      and cultivating the discourse on fashion, lifestyle, and beyond since

      I was set in motion to unearth the lost art of textual exuberance. In this
      extremely important, time sensitive, and highly requested endeavour, I
      analysed 22 years of US Vogue covers to ascertain if the amount of text on
      covers has indeed dwindled.
